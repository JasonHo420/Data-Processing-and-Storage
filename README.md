## How to modify this assignment for future use
For this assignment to become an official assignment I believe more examples need to be provided to cover all test cases of the database. Clarifications
to the instructions could be added such as what specific output should be provided and this should also, make the grading easier. Also, adding a remove
function could help simulate a more realistic database.
